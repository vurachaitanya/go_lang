# go_lang


### Advantages of Go:
-	Code runs faster
-	Garbage collections
-	Simpler objects
-	Concurrency is efficiency using goroutines
-	**Channels** help to solve this problem by providing a pattern that makes data safe from
concurrent modification. Channels help to enforce the pattern that only one goroutine should modify the data at any time



### Software Translation:
-	Machine language: Cpu instructions represented in binary
-	Assembly language: CPU instructions with Mnemonics - easy to read
-	High level Language: Commonly used language (C, C++, Java, Python, Go etc) - easy to use.



### Go Language
- Basics of GO Lang has been given each with an example 
- Variable, Strings, Conditions
