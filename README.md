### Advantages of Go:
-	Code runs faster
-	Garbage collections
-	Simpler objects
-	Concurrency is inbuilt which improves efficiency using **goroutines
-	**Channels** help to solve this problem by providing a pattern that makes data safe from
concurrent modification. Channels help to enforce the pattern that only one goroutine should modify the data at any time.
  - The first goroutine passes a data value through the channel to a second goroutine thatâ€™s already waiting. The exchange of the data between both goroutines is synchronized, and once the hand-off occurs, both goroutines know the exchange took place.



### Software Translation:
-	Machine language: Cpu instructions represented in binary
-	Assembly language: CPU instructions with Mnemonics - easy to read
-	High level Language: Commonly used language (C, C++, Java, Python, Go etc) - easy to use.
